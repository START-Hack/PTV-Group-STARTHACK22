# START Hack 2022 - PTV-Group Case 

### Case Introduction
# Value Proposition & Description
In urban metropolitan areas, the demand for delivery services and couriers is increasing in both private and business environments. 
Couriers transport goods from A to B within very short time spans and are paid for this on an order basis. In order to optimize their own resources, drivers lack the support they need to optimize the orders of the various order providers. Rider Dispatching solves this for the rider. 
A single rider with 6 pickup and delivery orders in one day has 39.000.000 trip sequence options.    
Live dispatching app for self-employed couriers enables drivers to select the most lucrative jobs in real time and increase their own earnings by 50-80%. 

### Decision support
The app receives in real-time orders from various services and offers only the orders to the driver which fit in the current plan and pay off economically for the driver. 
### Complex route optimization  
After accepting an order, the service re-plans all upcoming stops including their time slots and restrictions in such a way that the tour is optimal for the driver and he complies with all restrictions. 
### Empowering the network effect 
Due to the Uber virtuous circle the service generated faster pick-ups, more demand and lower prices. The driver benefits from a higher income, planning that takes his personal situation into account and less downtime.
